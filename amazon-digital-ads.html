                                    We are a consumerist society here in 2022, but Amazon has fed the beast! I mean,
                                    let’s be honest, I think many of us have shamefully had our recycling bins
                                    overfilling into our neighbor’s yard due to empty Amazon parcels. To add to the mix,
                                    Amazon’s ad business is boosting up in 2022 and profiting many other businesses as
                                    well!
                                </p>

                                <p class="blog-data">
                                    It seems like Amazon's resourceful drive into digital advertising will supercharge
                                    the company's expansion into the digital world, the reason being Amazon has truly
                                    changed the way we shop! While Google only assumes buying intentions, Amazon, on the
                                    other hand, has loads of first-hand consumer purchasing data, that it uses to
                                    improve its ad target.

                                        Advertising on Amazon is much similar to advertising on Google Ads. Amazon ads
                                        are
                                        usually denoted with subtle "ad" or "sponsored" text. So when you type in a
                                        keyword
                                        in the search box of Amazon, some of the top results will be sponsored posts,
                                        and
                                        these are considered Amazon Ads.

                                    </p>



                                    <p class="blog-data">
                                        Advertisers can pay for these positions by bidding on specific keywords so that
                                        they
                                        can achieve more visibility for their products, which will ultimately lead to
                                        higher
                                        visibility in the Amazon SERPs. So when a buyer clicks on their ad, the
                                        advertiser
                                        will be charged with some specific amount. You can practically notice that
                                        Amazon’s
                                        advertising platform is much like the Amazon version of Google Ads. So, like
                                        Google
                                        Ads, Amazon has plenty of ways you can link your products to suitable shoppers
                                        who
                                        are actively looking for products like yours!
